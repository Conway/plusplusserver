### pluspl.us is being shut down


Originally published: August 13, 2021


This Slack application will stop working on August 31, 2021. Thanks to everyone who has used the application throughout the years, I hope you found some value in it. See below for some questions and answers related to the sunset.

#### FAQ

##### Q: Why is the app being shut down?

A: Unfortunately, with the loads the app has been receiving it has become more costly to maintain than originally planned for, both time-wise and monetarily. It costs around $200 a year to run this app, and dozens of hours of my time for support and development. The app would also requires a non-trivial amount of time to update in order to comply with new Slack API regulations. 

##### Q: Is there any way to export my team's data for future use?

A: Yes! Use the command: '@pluspl.us export' and a link to a .csv file will be provided with the data for your team at the time the command is used.

##### Q: What will happen to my team's data?

A: All data will be securely and permanently erased on August 31, 2021. After that date, all data will be unrecoverable.

##### Q: Are there any replacement options?

A: Other Slack apps may provide similar functionality. Alternatively, the code for pluspl.us will remain available on [Github](https://github.com/plusplusslack/pluspl.us) should you wish to run an instance for your own Slack team. See [this branch](https://github.com/plusplusslack/pluspl.us/tree/pre-sunset) for the code prior to the sunset. 

##### Q: Is there anything I need to do to prepare?

A: Yes, export your team's data if you are interested in using it in the future, and then remove the application from your team. [This Slack help page](https://slack.com/help/articles/360003125231-Remove-apps-and-custom-integrations-from-your-workspace) describes how to remove an application. If you do not remove this app by August 31, 2021, it will be removed automatically.
